1. Before running this Microcontaminant Fate and Transport Model (MFTM), you should prepare 3 excel files: 
- Parameter values and save them under "Parameters_calibrated"
- Data of WWTPs and save them under "WWTP_data"
- Data of river stretches an save them under "River_data"
The explanation on how to collect and build these matrices can be found at 
Gimeno, P., Marcé, R., Bosch, L., Comas, J., Corominas, L., Incorporating
model uncertainty into the evaluation of interventions to reduce microcontaminant loads in rivers, Water
Research (2017), doi: 10.1016/j.watres.2017.07.036.

2. Start the model: To simulate the model you should run the script "inputs_results.m"

3. Results: With this model, you get the simulated influent and effluent loads of your contaminant at every WWTP and the simulated loads and concentrations 
and concentrations at every river stretch
